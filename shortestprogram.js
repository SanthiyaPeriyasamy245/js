// empty file is a shortest js program becuase eventhough the file is empty it'll create the memory space for it.
// whenever the global execution context created it'll create the global object called window in addition to this "this" kety word get created which is used to referr the window object.

// undefined and not defined
// undefines means when you access a variable before even it get intialised with some var;ue it gives you undefined.
// not defined means you are accessing a variable where the memory space is not even get created for that specific variable.
// example
console.log(a)
var a=10;
console.log(x) //  x is not declared in the program so no memory space get created for that so it shows not defined.
